# OS patch dataset   

### A brief introduction to the OS patch dataset
OS patch dataset is an optical and SAR image patch matching dataset with the patch size of 64 Ã— 64 pixels based on the OS dataset [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9204802)] and SIFT keypoint extraction. The dataset contains a total of 123,676 pairs of cross-spectral image patches with equal numbers of positive and negative samples. training set : test set=4 : 1 (98,940 : 24,736).   


### Document interpretation  
1. "finally_train.txt" denotes the point pair information of the training set.  
2. "finally_test.txt" denotes the point pair information of the test set .  
3. Each line in txt denotes a sample pair.  
4. Take one line as an example. The meaning of the corresponding position in "train, 175, 313, 431, 313, 431, 1" is "Folder name from OS dataset"; "image serial number"; "The x-coordinate of the keypoint of the optical image"; "The y-coordinate of the keypoint of the optical image"; "The x-coordinate of the keypoint of the SAR image"; "The y-coordinate of the keypoint of the SAR image"; "The label of the image pair. 1 for matching, 0 for nonmatching".  


### Construction of the dataset  
1. Download OS dataset [[link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14bqaJhMSZEy7EXcXVAc77w)] with the code "vriw".  
2. Build the corresponding dataset according to the point pair information in "finally_train.txt" and "finally_test.txt".  


### Other supplements
To view the experimental benchmark based on this data set, please view our paper "Efficient Feature Relation Learning Network for Cross-Spectral Image Patch Matching" [[link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10164118)] published on *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*. It is worth noting that the epochs of all methods in this experimental benchmark are set to 40.
